<h1>Demographic and Geographic Determinants of Health</h1>

<h2>How do health outcomes differ by demographic factors such as race and sex?</h2>

<p>Hispanic participants had the lowest morbidity and multimorbidity of weight-related illnesses. Black participants more frequently had diabetes, lung/respiratory problems, and obesity, whereas White participants had higher cholesterol and heart disease.</p>

<h2>How do health outcomes vary among individuals with differing access to supermarkets?</h2>

<p>At the individual level, adults who could not afford fruits and vegetables tended to have higher BMIs than those who could afford fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>This is supported by our findings using Census data. Surprisingly, clustering was found with obesity and food scarcity as a health outcome, so while there is an observable relationship between obesity and our measure of scarcity, itâ€™s not a very strong relationship.</p>
